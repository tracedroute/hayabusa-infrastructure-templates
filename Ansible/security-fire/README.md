# Security & Fire Systems

Ansible starters for commercial **fire alarm**, **intrusion**, **access control (PACS)**,
**video/VMS**, **mass notification**, and **BMS life-safety** integrations in the
Hayabusa Ansible & OpenTofu console.

## Safety

- Playbooks are **read-only by default**.
- Set `panel_apply_changes=true` (extra-var) only with owner/AHJ approval and a change window.
- Life-safety commands (silence, reset, unlock, notify) can affect real people and code compliance.

## Layout

- `playbooks/fire-alarm/` — Notifier, Simplex, EST, Siemens Desigo Fire, Potter, Gamewell-FCI, Hochiki, Farenhyt
- `playbooks/intrusion/` — DMP, Bosch, DSC Neo, Honeywell commercial, Qolsys
- `playbooks/access-control/` — Lenel OnGuard, Genetec, C-CURE, Avigilon ACM, HID, Brivo, Kisi
